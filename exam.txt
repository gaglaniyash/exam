1. a) Javascript is a popular scripting language which is used for making websites and web applications.
	Features of javascript:
	-Dynamic 
	-Easy to use
	-highly efficient
	-user friendly

   b)  ES6 is the latest versions of javascript in which new keywords like let and const where introduced.
	 ES6 has higher performance compared to ES5.
	 Object manipulation is less time coonsuming in ES6
	large range of community support.

	 ES5 is the fifth version of javascript defined by ecma international
	ES6 has lower performance compared to ES5.
	Object manipulation is time consuming in ES5
	smaller range of community support compared to ES5.

2. a) Variable are like containers which are used to hold any value.
	 Variable can be declared using three ways: let, var and const.

   b)	 There are two types of datatypes in javascript: Primitive and non-primitive
	Primitive datatypes:
	-Number
	-String
	-Boolean
	-Undefined
	-Null

	Non-Primitive datatypes:
	-Object
	-Array
	-Function

3. a) '==' opertor is used to check the equality of two values whereas '===' operator is used to check the equality as well as datype of the values.
   E.g let a = 4
	  let b = '4'
	 console.log(4 == 4)
	console.log(4 === 4)

   b) Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables and values.
  E.g let x = 5
	  let y = 6
	 let z = 8
	console.log(!(x || y && z))

Programs:

1) let a = 20
    let b = 30
   a = a + b
   b = a - b
   a = a - b
   console.log(a, b)
   Output: 20, 30

2) let marks = 75; 
   if(marks >= 90){
	console.log("A")
    }
   else if(marks > 80 && marks < 89){
	console.log("B")
    }
  else if(marks > 70 && marks < 79){
	console.log("C")
    }
  else(marks < 70){
	console.log("D")
    }

3) let cost = 200;
    let tax = 0.05;
    let tip = 0.10;
    let costincludingtax = 200 * 0.05 + cost;
    let costwithtaxandtip = costincludingtax * tip;
    let totalamount = cost + costwithtaxandtip;
    console.log(totalamount);
    Output: 210

4) let p = 10000;
    let r = 0.10;
    let t = 3;
    let simpleinterest =  (p*r*t) / 100;
   console.log(simpleinterest);
   Output: 30

5) let bs = 20000;
    let hra = 0.20 * bs;
    let da = 0.10 * bs;
    let totalsalary = bs + hra + da;
    console.log(totalsalary);
   Output: 6000
